# Percentile-Confidence-Interval-Calculation
Explored methods for calculating confidence intervals around the 70th percentile of a dataset. Implemented both a binomial-based approach and the more flexible bootstrap method, comparing their performance on real-world data. Visualized results using histograms and discussed the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
